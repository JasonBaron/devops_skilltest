This script current grabs the file list from a Debian release and prints the checksum and filename for each file. Adjust the script to only give the results for gz files.

The script must work on both Python 2 and 3.


**Please note:** *This folder contains a file named: main.txt -- you'll need to rename the file to main.py for it to work correctly but will need to rename it back to main.txt befor emailing. Many email systems restrict .py extensions when emailing.*
