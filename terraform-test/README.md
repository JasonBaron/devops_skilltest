**You will need Docker running locally to test this**

## Instruction

This creates a Docker container for Wordpress on the local Docker machine.

Update the configuration to launch N instances of the container based on the `wordpress_instance_count` variable using ports 9001 through 9xxx for the respective number of instances provided. The output should be changed to reflect the private IP of each container in a comma-separated list (e.g. `ip = 172.1.0.1,172.1.0.2,172.1.0.3,172.1.0.4,172.1.0.5`)

In your submitted PR, please put the output from both `terraform plan` and the output after `terraform apply` below with 3 containers provided as value on the `wordpress_instance_count` variable.
